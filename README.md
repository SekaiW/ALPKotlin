# What and Why
This project was written in Kotlin version 1.9.22. I picked this language because I barely knew it existed until I read the instructions.
After looking into it a little bit, I knew there would be a bit of a learning curve; but not to the point it would be unbearable.

# How Kotlin Handles...
**Object-Oriented Programming –**

**File Ingestion –**

**Conditional Statements –**

**Assignment Statements –**

**Loops –**

**Subprograms –**

**Unit Testing/Exception Handling –**

# Libraries Used:
One of the first libraries I used was the openCSV library from Maven. I *had* to use this library so I could read in the CSV file.

# Question Outputs:

**What company (oem) has the highest average weight of the phone body?**


**Was there any phones that were announced in one year and released in another? What are they? Give me the oem and models.**


**How many phones have only one feature sensor?**


**What year had the most phones launched in any year later than 1999?**
